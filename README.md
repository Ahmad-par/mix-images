# mix-images

This app can be used to select up to six images and mix them to do a simple collage.

After selecting and uploading your image, that will be resized to 640*480 pixels on the server and then a preview of that will be shown in the associated box.

The previews will be shown in twelve seperate equal cells that you can select every part and copy that to the final image.

In order to run this app locally you should have Node.js and npm installed. After cloning the repository run "npm init" in the app folder to install the dependencies. Then run "node app.js" to start the app.

If you want to serve this app on a local server you should change "serverAddress" variable in script.js to the IP address of the server.

You can go to this address to see a simpler version of this app with four boxes:
